# Pacman Game

This is just a side project to try out a few new technologies like es modules and to try and make a game using pixi.js.

# Run App

Make sure you have a static server like `serve` and also `yarn` installed globally.

```
npm i serve -g
npm i yarn -g
```

Install deps

```
yarn install
```

Then start your server.

```
serve
```

Open url it gives you in a [browser that supports es modules](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module) like chrome 61 or safari 10.1.
